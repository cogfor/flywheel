# Changelog

All notable changes to Flywheel will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and Flywheel adheres to [semver](https://semver.org/) starting at v1.0.0.
During the v0.x phase no compat promise is made between minor versions
(see design § Versioning).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `git_auto_sync.memory_limit` makes the shared worktree-sync controller's
  memory limit configurable, applied through both Flywheel reconciliation
  paths so a raised limit isn't reverted by the other one.

### Changed

- **The `git-auto-sync` default memory limit is now `256Mi` (was `128Mi`).**
  The limit scales with how many worktrees a client declares, not repo size:
  one shared controller forks Git subprocesses for all of them into a single
  cgroup. A measured 11-worktree client settles at a ~141Mi working set and
  OOMKill-looped roughly every 26 minutes under the old limit. Only the limit
  moved — the 32Mi request is unchanged, so this is a ceiling, not a
  reservation, and costs nothing at schedule time. Clients that pin
  `git_auto_sync.memory_limit` explicitly are unaffected.

  Note that a `flywheel.yaml` written by this version carries a
  `git_auto_sync:` block that an older CLI rejects (parsing is strict); pin
  the same version across the team, per the v0.x compat policy above.

### Fixed

- The image-builder controller now bypasses its informer cache when reading a
  referenced BuildKit Secret. Secret validation therefore uses the intended
  namespace-scoped `get` permission instead of attempting a cluster-wide
  Secret list/watch, which made the controller unready and stalled unrelated
  builds as soon as a build declared `secrets:`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### ⚠ BREAKING — per-app `git-auto-sync` sidecars are gone; existing gitops repos need a one-time manual migration

Upgrading `flywheel.version` to `0.3.0` and re-running `flywheel up` is **not
enough** for repos that already have apps. Per-app files under
`builders/base/<app>/` are rendered once by `flywheel add app` and never
re-rendered, so every existing app still carries a
`builders/base/<app>/git-auto-sync.yaml` Deployment running the OLD bash
sidecar — including its issue-#86 race.

**What you must do, per gitops repo, per app:**

```sh
git rm builders/base/<app>/git-auto-sync.yaml
# AND delete the "- ./git-auto-sync.yaml" line from builders/base/<app>/kustomization.yaml
git commit -am "migrate <app> to the shared git-auto-sync controller"
git push
```

Both edits must land together — the per-app `kustomization.yaml` references
the file, so deleting only the manifest breaks the kustomize build and the
whole `client-builders` tier goes NotReady until fixed.

Flux prunes the old sidecar Deployment; the new controller takes the app over
within a poll interval (~2s). Full walkthrough:
[Upgrading § Migrating off the per-app sidecar](docs/guides/upgrading.md#migrating-off-the-per-app-git-auto-sync-sidecar-existing-repos).

**Until you do this** the new controller deliberately stays hands-off for that
app (it skips it and logs one warning — look for `legacy git-auto-sync sidecar
Deployment still present` in `kubectl -n flywheel-system logs deploy/git-auto-sync`),
so there is never a two-writer window — but the app keeps syncing through the
old racy sidecar. Migrate each app on your own schedule; per-app migration is
independent.

**Not affected:** fresh `flywheel init` repos, and apps added with `flywheel
add app` on ≥0.3.0 (the sidecar is simply no longer rendered). RBAC changes
(the `git-auto-sync` Role gains `gitrepositories list, watch` + a
`deployments get, list, watch` rule) apply automatically via `flywheel up`.

### Changed (2026-07-17, per-app `git-auto-sync` is now a shared Go controller)

- **The per-app `git-auto-sync-<app>` bash sidecar (`scripts/git-auto-sync/sync.sh`)
  is replaced by a single Go controller** — one `git-auto-sync` Deployment in
  `flywheel-system` that LISTs/WATCHes every app's `GitRepository` and drives
  the same branch-follow/mirror tick, race-free (issue #86). The old sidecar
  had a TOCTOU window: a `git checkout` in the app worktree landing between
  its snapshot and its `reset --hard` could reset against the wrong branch or
  leave the in-cluster bare repo's `main` pointed at a commit from an
  already-abandoned branch — "poisoning" it so `ImagePolicy` could later
  latch a stale tag built from that content (the intermittent nightly
  scenario-4 failure). The new controller (`internal/appsync`) takes every
  decision against a `for-each-ref` snapshot (never bare `HEAD`) and
  re-verifies after every mutating step, rolling back and aborting the tick
  if a checkout raced it. It also writes with `umask 0` and neutralizes git
  hooks on every exec, fixing the root-owned-worktree-file (`EACCES`) facet.
  New `testdata/scenarios/scenario-6-branch-stress.sh` rapid-fires ~10
  sub-second branch flips to exercise the race directly (nightly-only, like
  scenarios 2-4). Measured on the release sha: warm commit→serving 6-7s
  (previous band 7-13s); the scenario-4 wedge mode (converge-never) is
  structurally impossible. See
  [design](docs/designs/2026-07-17-per-app-sync-controller-design.md) and
  [plan](docs/plans/2026-07-17-per-app-sync-controller-plan.md).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed (2026-07-02, mirror multi-arch released images under Docker's containerd image store)

- **`flywheel up` no longer fails at the image-mirror step on hosts using
  Docker's containerd image store when the source is a multi-arch released
  image** (issue #50). The mirror round-tripped every image through the host
  docker store (`docker pull → tag → push`); under the containerd store a pulled
  multi-arch reference is kept as an **index**, and `docker push` of that index
  to the local registry fails with `does not provide any platform`. Flywheel's
  released images are multi-arch, so the released-image path of `up` was broken
  on that configuration — the Colima default, and increasingly common on Docker
  Desktop. (The classic graphdriver store masked it by pulling a single concrete
  platform; single-arch dogfood images push fine, which is why the dogfood path
  never hit it.)
  - **Registry-hosted refs** (the default `ghcr.io/cobr-io/<name>:<version>` ref
    and any registry-qualified override) are now copied **registry→registry**,
    scoped to the host platform (`linux/<GOARCH>`), via the go-containerregistry
    library in-process. This resolves a multi-arch index to the single image the
    local k3d cluster runs and streams it straight into the local registry —
    never touching the docker store, so the containerd index-push cannot occur.
    It also moves the same bytes as today's single-arch pull while skipping the
    local-store round-trip.
  - **Local-only dogfood refs** (`flywheel-dev/<name>:dogfood`) keep the docker
    `tag`+`push` path: they name no registry, exist only in the host docker
    store, and are single-arch, so the index bug never applied.
  - Adds one Go module dependency (`github.com/google/go-containerregistry`)
    compiled into the static binary; **no new OS-level (PATH) dependency** — the
    `crane` binary is not invoked, and `flywheel doctor`'s host-tool checks are
    unchanged. Mirror failures now surface the underlying registry error instead
    of a bare `exit status 1`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Removed (2026-06-30, drop generic lint & secret-scanning from the client skeleton)

- **`flywheel init` no longer scaffolds yamllint or gitleaks into client
  repos.** The skeleton's mandate is the local dev loop plus the GitOps control
  plane it mirrors; general-purpose linting and secret scanning are repo hygiene
  any project wants regardless of Flywheel, so they're now bring-your-own.
  Removed: `.yamllint(.tmpl)` + its pre-commit hook; `.gitleaks.toml(.tmpl)` +
  its pre-commit hook, the CI full-history gitleaks scan step, `GITLEAKS_VERSION`,
  and the now-pointless `fetch-depth: 0`. The Flywheel-load-bearing guards
  (SOPS-shape, local-only) and the GitOps-control-plane CI (kustomize-build,
  kubeconform) are unchanged.
  - **Gotcha:** Flywheel commits `clusters/local/age.key` (an `AGE-SECRET-KEY`)
    on purpose, and the dropped `.gitleaks.toml` was the allowlist that kept a
    scanner quiet about it. A client's own scanner / GitHub push-protection will
    now flag it, so `docs/guides/onboarding.md` gains a note to allowlist that
    path.

### Added (2026-06-30, flywheel-free bring-up guide)

- **New guide `docs/flywheel-free-bringup.md`** documenting how to bring the same
  local cluster up with stock Flux and **zero `flywheel` binary** (you forgo the
  fast dev loop). `apps/` and `infra/` are plain Kustomize, so the guide walks
  through hand-authoring a vanilla `clusters/local/flux-system/` entrypoint
  (`GitRepository` → your GitHub remote plus `client-infra`/`client-apps`
  `Kustomization`s), the bring-up steps, and the one caveat — app manifests ship
  a dev-loop `:0-placeholder` image that only flywheel's image automation
  rewrites, so vanilla pods need real, pullable image refs committed. Linked from
  the Flywheel README's guide index and the scaffolded client README. This keeps
  the anti-lock-in story as **documentation** rather than tool logic: `flywheel
  init` does not scaffold the entrypoint for you.
  - An earlier iteration had `flywheel init` commit the vanilla entrypoint into
    every client repo; that was reverted before release in favor of this guide,
    so the tool itself carries no flywheel-escape machinery.

### Changed (2026-06-18, `add-app` → `add app`)

- **BREAKING: `flywheel add-app` is now `flywheel add app`.** The flat `add-app`
  command was reorganized under a new `add` parent command, anticipating future
  `add <resource>` subcommands (e.g. `add env`). The old `add-app` spelling is
  removed entirely — there is no alias. Flags, args, and behavior are otherwise
  unchanged. Running bare `flywheel add` prints help and exits 2.

### Added (2026-06-17, guard against non-mountable workspace paths)

- **`flywheel init`/`up` now refuse to run from a host path Docker Desktop can't
  bind-mount into k3d** (macOS temp dirs: `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/var/folders`).
  Previously, cloning a gitops repo into `/tmp` produced a cluster whose
  `/workspaces` was empty, so git-auto-sync-self couldn't push the repo and the
  client-* Flux Kustomizations failed with a cryptic "Source artifact not found".
  - The path refusal is **macOS-only** (Linux/CI mount any host path fine) and
    can be overridden with `FLYWHEEL_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_WORKSPACE=1`.
  - `flywheel up` also **verifies the mount actually bridged** after creating the
    cluster — it checks the gitops repo is visible in-cluster at
    `/workspaces/<repo>` and fails fast with remediation if not. This is
    config-agnostic (catches any Docker Desktop file-sharing misconfig, not just
    temp dirs).
  - `flywheel doctor` (full) warns when the gitops repo is on such a path.
  - New `internal/cli/hostmount` package; new `k3d.WorkspaceVisible` probe.

### Changed (2026-06-17, mirror all images to the local registry; drop k3d side-load)

- **`flywheel up`/`update` now mirror every Flywheel image into the cluster's
  local registry**, for both released (ghcr) and dogfood (override) images, and
  the manifests reference the in-cluster registry pull ref
  (`k3d-<registry>:5000/<name>:<tag>`). Previously only dogfood overrides went
  to the registry while released images were side-loaded with `k3d image
  import`.
  - A released image is pulled to the host then pushed under its immutable
    `:<version>` tag; a dogfood override under a content-addressed
    `:dogfood-<sha>` tag (unchanged).
  - **`k3d image import` is gone entirely** — no per-node side-load, which could
    miss a node or be GC-evicted (issue #14). Every node now pulls on demand
    from the registry, including released images. This also removes the
    requirement that a node reach ghcr (and have pull credentials) at schedule
    time, so private release images and offline-after-pull work.
  - `imagepin.EnsureInCluster` lost its `clusterName` parameter and the
    `k3dImport` helper was removed. `add-app` references the registry pull ref
    for default images too (computed, no docker work — `up` already mirrored
    them).
  - Step-9 log wording now reads `mirroring Flywheel images to the local
    registry` and distinguishes released vs dogfood per image.

### Removed (2026-06-10, drop multi-profile / tailscale support)

- **The local TLS "profile" concept is gone.** Flywheel now supports a
  single, hardcoded local TLS setup (`mkcert`); the `tailscale-le-wildcard`
  profile and the whole profile-selection machinery have been removed.
  - `flywheel.yaml`'s `local.profile` field and the `local.tailscale` block
    are no longer part of the schema (and are rejected).
  - `flywheel init --profile` and `flywheel doctor --mkcert` flags are
    removed; mkcert is always a prerequisite, always checked.
  - `manifests/infra/overlays/local-{mkcert,tailscale}` are collapsed into a
    single `manifests/infra/`; the `flywheel-infra` Flux Kustomization now
    reconciles `./manifests/infra` directly.
  - The `up` step-4 profile-switch detection is removed (every `up` is
    additive in v0.1.0, as documented).
  - **`flywheel clean --crds` is removed.** Its only purpose was reaping the
    cert-manager / tailscale-operator CRDs the tailscale profile installed;
    mkcert installs no operator CRDs, so the flag was orphaned. `flywheel
    clean` (orphaned-PVC cleanup) is unchanged.

### Changed (2026-06-02, add-app worktree decoupling + cobra CLI)

- **The CLI is now built on cobra** (behaviour-preserving migration of the
  hand-rolled subcommand dispatch). Globals (`--no-color`, `-v/--verbose`) are
  persistent flags. New: `flywheel completion <shell>` plus dynamic argument
  completion. The retired `new` command is removed (use `init`).
- **`flywheel add-app` now takes a worktree `<dir>`, not an app `<name>`.** The
  directory (a child of `workspaces_root`; bare name, relative, or absolute
  path) drives the physical bindings — the `/workspaces` mount, the bare-repo
  URL, `GitRepository.spec.url` — while the **app name** drives logical identity
  (folders, resource names, Ingress host, image). The name is `--name`, else
  **derived** from a project manifest in the directory
  (`package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` / `go.mod` / `Cargo.toml` /
  `composer.json` / `pom.xml` / `*.gemspec`), else the directory name.
  - **Behaviour change:** when a manifest declares a name it now wins over the
    directory name — pass `--name` to pin. `add-app <dir>` where the directory
    has no manifest name still scaffolds exactly as before.
  - add-app now validates that `<dir>` exists and is a direct child of
    `workspaces_root`, closing a silent-failure mode (a wrong name used to just
    never build). `<dir>` tab-completes to the available worktrees.
- **`make install`** builds a version-stamped binary and installs shell
  completions; **`flywheel version`** now reports `BuildVersion` (the
  git-describe stamp) instead of a hardcoded string. See
  [design](docs/designs/2026-06-02-add-app-worktree-decoupling-design.md).

### Changed (2026-06-01, BuildKit builder)

- **The local builder is now BuildKit, not Kaniko.** A warm rootless
  `buildkitd` Deployment (+ cache PVC + Service) runs in `flywheel-system`
  (`manifests/dev-loop/base/buildkitd.yaml`); each observed commit creates a
  thin `buildctl` client Job that drives it. The build cache lives in the
  daemon's snapshot store, so a code-only change reuses the dependency layer
  instantly instead of paying Kaniko's ~13s cached-layer-extract + ~5s
  layer-push tax on every build. See
  [design](docs/designs/2026-06-01-buildkit-builder.md).
  - **Measured on a heavy multi-stage Go image (paritytest):** warm build
    (code-only change) **38s → 12s** (the `buildctl` step is ~7s — just the
    `go build`; the dep layer is a daemon-cache hit); cold **45s → 32s**;
    end-to-end commit→pod warm **~9-18s** (the spread is the deploy back-half,
    not the build). On a trivial single-layer image there's no difference —
    the win is layer-cacheable real Dockerfiles, which is the actual client
    case.
  - Rootless (no privileged container); the insecure k3d registry is handled
    per-build by `registry.insecure=true` on the buildctl output, so buildkitd
    needs no per-client config. The build container keeps the name `kaniko` so
    the build-Pod scan poke (above) is unchanged. `pods` get/list/watch was
    already added for that poke; no new RBAC here. The build CPU ceiling now
    lives on the daemon (the daemon does the work) as a fixed `cpu: "4"` limit
    on the `buildkitd` Deployment — there is no `BUILD_CPU_LIMIT` env/flag
    anymore (the parity-loop entry below that introduced it is superseded by
    this one); a configurable `build.cpu_limit` knob is a follow-up.
    `moby/buildkit` is pulled on demand (offline pre-import is a follow-up).
  - Removed: `kaniko-cache-pvc.yaml`, the Kaniko Job template (now
    `templates/build-job.yaml` emitting buildctl). The Kaniko engine was
    removed outright, not kept behind a switch.

### Changed (2026-06-01, parity-loop latency)

> **Engine-specific details below are superseded by the BuildKit builder entry
> above** (same day). The Kaniko latency figures, the `kaniko`-container scan
> timings, and the `BUILD_CPU_LIMIT` knob describe the pre-BuildKit engine and
> no longer reflect shipped behaviour. The event-trigger and dependency-requeue
> work (the bulk of this entry) is engine-independent and still stands.

The local commit-to-pod loop was ~25-40s with an intermittent ~40s
outlier (~1 run in 4). It is now **~11-15s, consistently, with the
outlier removed** — measured on a live k3d cluster (dogfood images,
trivial nginx app). The Kaniko build (~9-11s) now dominates; the rest of
the loop is a few seconds. Three changes, each landed only after the root
cause was confirmed by per-controller tracing — not inference:

- **Event-trigger the two hops that were genuinely poll-bound** (Flux's
  `reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt`; best-effort, so a missed poke just
  falls back to the normal interval and reconciliation/parity is
  unchanged):
  - `git-auto-sync` (`scripts/git-auto-sync/sync.sh`) annotates its
    GitRepository whenever a push or fast-forward moves the bare-repo head
    (app source re-fetches on commit; gitops source re-fetches when the
    image-tag bump lands), and the gitops/self sync also pokes the
    `client-apps` Kustomization — but only *after* waiting for the source
    artifact to advance to the new commit, so kustomize-controller applies
    the new revision on that trigger instead of reconciling the stale one.
    (`KUSTOMIZATION_NAME` env on the self sync; `kustomizations` get/patch
    on the `git-auto-sync-flux-system` Role.)
  - A new `BuildJobReconciler` in the image-builder-controller pokes the
    matching ImageRepository to scan the instant a build Job succeeds.
    Bumped via a JSON **merge patch** of just the annotation (a
    read-modify-write Update races image-reflector's own status writes and
    loses with "the object has been modified"). `imagerepositories`
    get/patch added to the controller ClusterRole.
  - **Deliberately NOT poking the ImageUpdateAutomation.** An earlier
    revision did, with `APIReader`/advance-tag machinery; tracing proved it
    dead weight — the IUA already self-reconciles every 5s and commits the
    bump within ~8s of the build regardless, and the poke's policy snapshot
    raced the reflector so it never fired usefully. That code and its
    `imagepolicies`/`imageupdateautomations` RBAC were removed.
- **The ~40s outlier was a `dependsOn` requeue, not a poll interval.**
  Per-controller tracing of a captured outlier showed: every Kustomization
  flips `Ready=Unknown` for ~260ms on *each* routine interval reconcile
  (even a no-op), and an image-bump revision fans out a reconcile to all
  dependents at once. When that fan-out coincides with a transitive
  dependency's 260ms blink, the dependent hits kustomize-controller's
  `--requeue-dependency` backoff — **a fixed 30s constant, independent of
  every `interval`.** Two changes attack it:
  - **A — `--requeue-dependency=30s→2s`** on kustomize-controller. Caps
    the worst case at 2s if the race still hits. The embedded Flux
    `install.yaml` stays **pristine upstream** (clean re-vendor); the flag
    is injected by a programmatic transform in `flux.Install` at apply
    time (`internal/cli/flux`), guarded by a unit test that fails if a
    future re-vendor pre-sets the flag or drops the kustomize-controller
    Deployment.
  - **C — raise the mirror-sourced tiers' interval 10s→5m**
    (`flywheel-dev-loop`, `flywheel-infra`). They change only on
    `flywheel up` (which applies them directly), so a 10s poll bought
    nothing but blink frequency; 5m cuts the coincidence window ~30×. The
    client tiers stay at `flux.interval_local` so client edits stay
    responsive.
- **Verified on the live cluster** (changes delivered through `flywheel
  up` → in-cluster mirror, nothing hand-applied): **14 spaced commits all
  10.8-15.3s, zero dependency requeues, zero outliers.** Rapid-fire (6
  commits ~3s apart) still triggered 3 dependency requeues — but each cost
  ~2s (A) instead of 30s, so the cluster still converged to the newest
  commit +10s after the last commit. So C makes the race rare; A makes it
  cheap when it still happens.
- **Scan poke now fires on the kaniko *container* exit, not the Job's
  Complete condition.** The image lands in the registry the instant kaniko
  exits 0, but the Job isn't marked Complete until kubelet tears the pod
  down and the job-controller observes it — ~4s later, measured, dead on
  the critical path. `BuildJobReconciler` now watches build *Pods*
  (`pods` get/list/watch added to its ClusterRole) and pokes the
  ImageRepository scan off the kaniko container's terminated/exit-0 state.
  Verified: kaniko-done→IUA-push dropped from ~4s to ~0.7-1s. Commit-to-pod
  decomposes to ~11s as: fetch-source initContainer ~3s + container-start
  gap ~2s + kaniko ~3s + (scan→IUA→apply→pod) ~3s. The build *Pod* (two
  serial container cold-starts + build) is now the dominant term — the
  target of the BuildKit work (which can also fold the separate
  git-fetch initContainer into the builder, removing one cold start).
- **Build CPU limit is now a burst ceiling of 2 (was 1).** Builds
  are CPU-bound (~2x faster at 2 vs 1 core); the request stays at 200m,
  so this only consumes cores when they're free and never oversubscribes
  a constrained VM's scheduler. *(Superseded by the BuildKit entry above:
  the ceiling moved onto the `buildkitd` daemon as a fixed `cpu: "4"`
  limit. The `BUILD_CPU_LIMIT` env / `--build-cpu-limit` flag this entry
  described was never shipped; a configurable `build.cpu_limit` knob
  remains a follow-up.)*

### Changed (2026-05-28, second pass)

- **CLI output now styled with ANSI colours + Unicode glyphs**. Step
  headers render bold cyan with `▶`, success lines dim with `✓`,
  warnings bold yellow with `⚠`, errors bold red with `✗`. Honours
  `NO_COLOR` (any value disables), `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` (forces on),
  and a top-level `--no-color` flag; auto-disables when stdout is
  not a TTY. Hand-rolled (~80 LoC + tests) in `internal/cli/style`;
  no new third-party deps.
- **`flywheel up`'s long waits now show what they're waiting for**.
  Step 10 (Flux Deployments coming up) and step 14 (Flux
  Kustomizations Ready) used to sit silent for minutes; they now
  render a live in-place block per item:

  ```
  ▶ waiting for Flux Kustomizations Ready
    ⠋ client-apps         blocked on: client-infra      5s
    ✓ client-infra        ready                         3s
    …
  ```

  On TTY: cursor-up + clear-to-end + redraw on every poll, ~2s.
  Off-TTY (pipe / CI): a `Detail` heartbeat line every status
  change or every ~20s, with the oldest pending item named. The
  block collapses to one summary line on success. Flux dependsOn
  lag is parsed out of the Kustomization message and surfaced as
  `blocked on: <dep>` so the user sees which link is holding the
  chain. New `style.Waiter` in `internal/cli/style/wait.go`.
- **Default output is now quiet**. Subprocess chatter that used to
  inline into the user-facing log — k3d's `[INFO]/[ERRO]` lines from
  `k3d image import`, docker pull progress, the mkcert install
  banner, client-go's port-forward "Forwarding from …" notices,
  klog `E0000 …` warnings, and the applier's per-resource `ok …`
  chatter on every apply — is hidden in the default run. Pass
  `-v` / `--verbose` to surface all of it for diagnosis.
  Implemented via `style.VerboseWriter(w)` (returns `io.Discard`
  unless verbose) routed through each shell-out callsite +
  `klog.SetOutput(io.Discard)` for client-go warnings. The
  per-resource ok line is gated through `style.OKv` (verbose-only
  OK).
- **Animated progress spinner for one-shot waits**. With subprocess
  chatter hidden, silent steps now show the same braille-spinner
  glyph the Waiter uses, ticking elapsed time in place:

  ```
  ⠹ k3d cluster myapp-local  47s
  ```

  When the step finishes, the spinner line is replaced by a dim
  `✓ k3d cluster myapp-local (1m28s)` summary. On failure it
  becomes a bold-yellow `⚠ <step> failed (1m28s)`. New `style.Spin`
  helper; wired into `flywheel up`'s registry / cluster create,
  per-image k3d image-import, Flux install, dev-loop apply, mirror
  push, namespace + flywheel-config apply, age + local-cert
  secrets, and the bootstrap flux-system apply. Also wired into
  `flywheel down`'s stop and `flywheel destroy`'s
  cluster-and-registry deletes.

  Degraded modes: when stdout isn't a TTY (logs / CI) or `-v` is
  on (where subprocess output would otherwise clash with the in-
  place redraw), `Spin` skips the animation and prints a plain
  step header + final outcome line — no ANSI escapes, log-safe.

### Changed (2026-05-28)

- **The Flux entrypoint (`clusters/local/flux-system/`) is no longer
  rendered into the client gitops repo**. It's bootstrap-only — applied
  once by `flywheel up` step 11d, then Flux reconciles only its
  `sourceRef` targets (the Flywheel mirror + `builders/`, `apps/`,
  `infra/` from the gitops repo). The templates now live under
  `templates/bootstrap/` in the binary; `flywheel up` renders them to a
  tmpdir with runtime values (resolved image refs, embed-cache SHA, repo
  basename) and applies. The tmpdir is removed on exit.
  - Eliminates the git-auto-sync ↔ refresh-overlay race: there's
    nothing in the committed repo for `git-auto-sync` to reset, and no
    "refresh" step that produces uncommitted churn.
  - `.local` edits flow through on the very next `up` (the values feed
    straight from `cfg.Flywheel.Images` into the rendered templates).
  - The user's committed gitops repo now contains only what Flux
    actually reconciles: `flywheel.yaml`, `builders/`, `apps/`,
    `infra/`. Existing clients can `git rm -r clusters/` after
    upgrading; nothing in the binary references that path anymore.
  - Removes `up.refreshFluxOverlay` + the three `renderBuildersKustomization`/
    `renderFlywheelSource`/`renderSelfGitAutoSync` helpers (replaced
    by the embedded templates and `up.renderBootstrap`).
  - Goldens shrink (the `clusters/local/flux-system/` subtree is gone
    from `internal/cli/new/testdata/golden/{mkcert,tailscale}/`).

### Fixed (2026-05-28)

- `flywheel init` now reuses an existing age key at
  `~/.config/flywheel/<client>/age.key` instead of refusing to proceed.
  The age key is a per-developer identity, not a per-cluster artefact —
  destroying and re-initing a cluster must preserve the same key so any
  committed `*.sops.yaml` files in the gitops repo stay decryptable.
  `flywheel destroy` is unchanged (intentionally leaves the key on
  disk); the bug was on the init side. Generation still fires on first
  init or when the key file is absent.
- `flywheel add-app` now merges `flywheel.yaml.local` before resolving
  image refs, so per-developer image overrides flow into the rendered
  per-app git-auto-sync Deployment. Previously dogfood clusters would
  hit `ErrImagePull` on the default ghcr.io ref.
- `image-builder-controller` now sweeps orphaned Kaniko build Jobs
  when their source `GitRepository` is deleted. Cross-namespace owner
  references aren't honoured by Kubernetes garbage collection — the
  Jobs live in `flywheel-system`, the `GitRepository` lives in `apps` —
  so the controller reaps Jobs labelled `app=image-builder,repo=<dead>`
  in its own `Reconcile` on the delete event.
- `image-builder-controller` also reaps the orphan `GitRepository`
  itself when its build-config ConfigMap is gone. Per-app
  `GitRepository`s carry `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile:
  disabled` (set imperatively by git-auto-sync to win the Open Issue
  #11 race on `spec.ref.branch`), which also blocks Flux's prune. The
  controller deletes the stranded `GitRepository` directly (the
  annotation only blocks Flux reconciles, not generic API deletes);
  the subsequent delete event fires `IsNotFound` and the Job sweep.
  RBAC was widened to grant `delete` on `gitrepositories` in `apps`.
- New scenario `testdata/scenarios/scenario-5-orphan-job-reaper.sh`
  exercises the full flow on a live cluster (remove builder → assert
  GR pruned → assert Jobs reaped) and is wired into both `run-all.sh`
  and the k3d-e2e CI job.

### Changed (dogfood pass, 2026-05-27)

- `flywheel new` is retired and replaced by `flywheel init [<path>]`:
  no argument initialises the current directory (Name derived from
  `basename(cwd)`); an argument creates / initialises that path. Empty
  or `.git`-only targets are accepted; any other content is refused.
- The binary now `go:embed`s `templates/client-skeleton/`,
  `manifests/`, and `manifests/per-app-template/` — `init`, `up`, and
  `add-app` no longer need a git clone of `github.com/cobr-io/flywheel`
  at runtime. The `FLYWHEEL_REPO_URL`, `--local-build`, and
  `FLYWHEEL_BUILD_ROOT` knobs are gone (removed with `gitcache` and
  `dockermirror`).
- `up` step 3 derives a deterministic commit SHA from the embedded
  asset tree via the new `embedcache` package (no network,
  reproducible).
- `up` step 9 loads the three runtime images via the new `imagepin`
  package: `cfg.flywheel.images.<name>` override or
  `ghcr.io/cobr-io/<name>:<flywheel.version>`; loaded into the
  cluster's containerd via `k3d image import` from the host docker
  store (else `docker pull`). If the default ghcr.io ref isn't
  published and no override is set, hard-fail with a remediation
  pointer (option (c)).
- `up` step 11d refreshes the committed
  `clusters/local/flux-system/{builders-kustomization,flywheel-source}.yaml`
  to reflect resolved image refs + current embed SHA, then applies.
  The committed copy becomes a normal git diff the developer can
  commit.

### Added

- `flywheel add-app <name>` (promoted from Phase 3): renders the
  embedded per-app-template into `builders/base/<name>/` and appends
  the entry to `builders/base/kustomization.yaml`. Honours
  `cfg.flywheel.images.git-auto-sync` so per-developer dogfood image
  overrides flow through.
- `flywheel.images.{git-server,git-auto-sync,image-builder-controller}`
  config block (optional). Natural home for per-developer dogfood
  overrides is `flywheel.yaml.local`.

### Added

- Phase 0 scaffold: repo skeleton, Dockerfiles + scripts (git-server,
  git-auto-sync, image-builder-controller), parameterised
  image-builder-controller reading `flywheel-config` ConfigMap,
  dev-loop manifests (incl. privileged inotify-bump DaemonSet), infra
  overlays (mkcert + tailscale-le-wildcard), per-app template,
  client-skeleton template, CLI skeleton (`doctor` implemented; others
  stubbed), schema validator (v1alpha1), config merger (`.local`
  arrays-replace-wholesale), allocator (~/.config/flywheel/allocations.json),
  goreleaser config, release + test workflows.
- Phase 1: `flywheel new`, `up` (full 15-step pipeline incl. in-cluster
  Flywheel mirror for offline reconcile), `down`, `destroy`, full
  `doctor`. Dev-loop validated end-to-end on k3d (commit → build →
  deploy → serve) plus app-repo and gitops-repo branch switches.
  Embedded Flux v2.8.7 install; client-go SSA applies with
  fieldManager=flux-controller; go-git tag→SHA + cache + in-cluster
  mirror push.
- `flywheel up` step 4 (reconcile diff) + step 12 (orphan deletes):
  profile-switch detection categorises changes additive/mutating/
  destructive, gates destructive ops behind `--yes`, and tiers CRDs +
  PVCs out of auto-deletion (never deleted by `up`).
- `flywheel clean [--orphaned] [--crds]`: removes orphaned PVCs; removes
  orphaned CRDs only after a foreign-CR safety check (refuses if any CR
  isn't labeled `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=flywheel`).
- Dev-loop validation scenarios (testdata/scenarios/) + CI k3d-e2e job.

- Open Issue #11 hardening: the gitops git-auto-sync suspends the
  `flywheel-self` ImageUpdateAutomation for the duration of a branch
  switch (resumes once settled; self-healing on crash/startup), so IAC
  can't commit to the gitops bare repo mid-switch. All four dev-loop
  scenarios — including scenario 4 (both repos on independent feature
  branches simultaneously) — pass on a clean cluster.
